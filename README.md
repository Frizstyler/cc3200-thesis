AP with TCP server and LCD thesis.

This is the code from my thesis project where an AP is set up with the board,
where TCP messages from a client can be sent & printed on the LCD screen.If the message is
bigger than 16 chars the message is shifted left until all is displayed.
The android app "socket test" was used for the client.
